### v1
- [ ] make some precise user stories
- [ ] create 3 rings :ring:
- [ ] fake scrolling effect of 5 `tastes` at once
- [ ] nice transition effect when _scrolling_ or changing a ring, ie: from `R1 >> R2` or `R2 >> R1`
- [ ] ofc, make it responsive :iphone: (with 2 differents UX depending of the layout, `landscape or portait`)
- [ ] save folk's choices (FBase :fire:) with a simple mail
- [ ] v1 should at least have simple but decent UI :sparkles:

- [ ] connect it to the Nuxt app to let buddy make his articles :book:

### Tech to use
- Bulma for the global design
- Popmotion for the kinetics of the wheel and the touch support
