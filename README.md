# Wheelsky :beer:

In short, the goal is to make a marvelous whisky flavours wheel, like this one. But, a not ugly one.

### v1
- [x] make some precise user stories
- [x] create 3 rings :ring:
- [ ] fake scrolling effect of 5 `tastes` at once
- [ ] nice transition effect when _scrolling_ or changing a ring, ie: from `R1 >> R2` or `R2 >> R1`
- [ ] ofc, make it responsive :iphone: (with 2 differents UX depending of the layout, `landscape or portait`)
- [x] save folk's choices (FBase :fire:) with a simple mail
- [ ] v1 should at least have simple but decent UI :sparkles:

### v2
- [ ] make a real and well structured svg
- [ ] clean the code
- [ ] use only one touch library (instead of the current mix)
- [ ] secure the FBase DB
- [ ] send some mails then ?
- [ ] make the whole pretty and responsive
- [ ] implement minor things like the double click to erase an entry, typos, remove the selected flavors
- [ ] UI stuff ?

### v3 (other app ?)
- [ ] find a nice headless CMS (Contentful, ButterCMS, GraphCMS)
- [ ] connect it to the Nuxt app to let buddy make his articles :book:

### Tech to use
- Bulma for the global design
- Popmotion for the kinetics of the wheel and the touch support
- Greensock ?
- Other details can be found on the Trello
